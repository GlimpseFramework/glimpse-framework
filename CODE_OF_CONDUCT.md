# Code of Conduct

* **Focus on the topic.**
Sometimes a discussion might go astray. Before posing a new comment, check if it is releted to the original topic.
The topic usually involves the code or a framework feature. If you focus on a person, you are most probably far afield.
* **Use professional language.**
Always review your comments before posting. Consider whether the words you used, are best choice in this context.
* **Assume good intentions.**
Miscommunication is nothing uncommon, especially in an internetional community.
Before you report an abuse, think what the other person really wanted to say.
Remember that offence is taken, not given. If somebody has intentionally insulted you,
their comment is most probably against one of the previous rules.
